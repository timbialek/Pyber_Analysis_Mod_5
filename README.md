# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
> The project we have been assigned it to create a summary of the PyBer data by the city types of Urban, Suburban, and Rural and to show the metrics for total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fair per ride and average fare per driver. Once we have created the metrics, we then need to create a multi-line graph to display the weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we will summarize the results and present our recommendations

## Resources
